These are the docker build files however the SASHomeTar.tar is absent. To build the SASHomeTar.tar file you will need to install SAS 9.4 on a similar build to the one referenced in the Docker file (I built it on Ubuntu (18.04)) Then tar the SASHome folder and place it in your repository clone before building the docker image.
